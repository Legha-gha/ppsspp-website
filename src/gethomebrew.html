          <h2>PSP Demos</h2>
          <p>Many game companies released downloadable demo versions of their games for the PSP. Some of these can run in PPSSPP. These files are legal and free to download. A good site to download them is the <a href="http://www.playdreamcreate.com/">PSP Demo Center</a>.</p> You may have to unzip the downloaded demos on your PC, PPSSPP does not have an internal unpacker yet but is getting one soon.</p>

          <h2>PSP Homebrew</h2>

          <h3>What are they?</h3>
          <p>The PSP was released in 2005, and contained a number of bugs that made it easy to run your own code on the device. A large community of hackers emerged who wrote their own software for the device. There's now a lot of little homemade games to run.</p>

          <h3>Where can I find them?</h3>
          <p>I will soon post a collection of links here. In the future, PPSSPP will also be able to automatically download and install homebrew games.</p>

          <h3>How do I get them on my device?</h3>
          <p>If you are running the PC version of PPSSPP and you have the game you want to run as an ISO, just do File-Open Memstick, open PSP/GAME, and put your homebrew there in folders. It will then show up on the Homebrew tab in the emulator.<p>
